## What is this?
This is my new site for sharing my rstats learning. The site is generated by the [blogdown package](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). [Here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) is Yihui Xie's helpful book-in-progress. Yihui is the developer of blogdown. This whole setup is super-cool. For example, LaTex support is built-in with this theme; apparently, a pair of a pair of dollar signs will render inline questions, as in $$ f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k} $$ 


## Components of this site
I basically followed Amber Thomas' wonderful tutorial [here](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/). The steps include:

* Create the GitHub repo; the repo for this site is located at https://github.com/bionicturtle/bt-rstats-blog
* Clone the remote repo to a locale director
* Install Hugo; see https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/
* Install blogdown 
* But instead of using GitHub pages, I found https://app.netlify.com to be very easy. What is netlify? Well, I'm not *entirely* sure yet, lol, but it's a bit magical. It is "continuous deployment" of my site build at GitHub. Geez, these kids are smart. 

So now, to create a post, I simply issue the blogdown command new_post(), which creates either a plain Markdown (\*.md) or an R Markdown (\*.Rmd) file. By default, this is created in subdiretory \\content\\post.

That's my first step. There is so much to learn ...
